About: For the final I decided to make an app that allows users to share what items they want for Christmas. Details about the gifts include what it is, where to get it,
the price, an image url and who wants the gift. Users can also filter gifts by name which appends the gifts on the page.
The app is based around past concepts we learned in the list app and the reddit app.
The app does not include any apis and uses localhosting.
Users are able to create a 'Wish', as well as update or delete wishes via the home page.
When creating a wish I found the best way to upload an image was to copy the image address of an image online and paste it into the url field.
When viewing a wish users can find the remaining details about the wish
Wishes can be filtered by name with the search bar and they are appended at the bottom of the page.

Github was acting strange at the time of upload and wasn't allowing me to upload the entire folder. Instead I only uploaded the main files.
