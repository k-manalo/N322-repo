Note: When I ran ionic build --prod I was getting an error for my [(ngModel)]. This ngModel allowed users to be able to filter items
by the person who wants that item. I ultimately had to remove the feature as I couldn't find anything online useful to me, nor could I find
any class lectures that went over my exact issue.
