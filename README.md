Note: When I ran ionic build --prod I was getting an error for my [(ngModel)]. This ngModel allowed users to be able to filter items
by the person who wants that item. I ultimately had to remove the feature as I couldn't find anything online useful to me, nor could I find
any class lectures that went over my exact issue.

About: For the final I decided to make an app that allows users to share what items they want for Christmas. Details about the gifts include what it is, where to get it,
the price, an image url and who wants the gift.
The app is based around past concepts we learned in the list app and the reddit app.
The app does not include any apis and uses localhosting.
Users are able to create a 'Wish', as well as update or delete wishes via the home page.
When creating a wish I found the best way to upload an image was to copy the image address of an image online and paste it into the url field.
When viewing a wish users can find the remaining details about the wish

Github was acting strange at the time of upload and wasn't allowing me to upload the entire folder. Instead I only uploaded the main files.
